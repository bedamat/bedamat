Heyhey! 

ðŸ”­  Iâ€™m attending a WebDeveloper Course at the <a href="https://digitalcareerinstitute.org/" target="blank">Digital Career Institute</a> until spring 2022.


ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m going to learn HTML, Css, JavaScript, some frameworks, patience and a bunch of other things... 

ðŸ’¬  Before this I worked as a Gaffer or Lighting Technician in the Movies since 1998. In between I studied systems theory and cybernetics, so I'm good with logic based stuff and complex correlations.


ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on fun stuff, but I'm quite busy, so it has to be really good fun..
Generally I'm interested in culture and art and I like to create live experiences like events, retreats, adventure trips or art- or humanitarian interventions..
