Heyhey! 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m attending the WebDeveloper Course of the <a href="https://digitalcareerinstitute.org/" target="blank">Digital Career Institute</a> until spring 2022.


ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m going to learn HTML, css, javascript, patience and a bunch of other things... 

ðŸ’¬  I studied systems theory / cybernetics and Music- and Media Management so I am really good with logic based stuff and I am quite savvy with all kinds of media productions and applications, and how to get them somewhere.


ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on fun stuff, but I'm quite busy, so it has to be really good fun..
Generally I'm interested in culture and art and I like to create live experiences like events, retreats, adventure trips or art- or humanitarian interventions..
