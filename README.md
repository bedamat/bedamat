Heyhey! 

ðŸ”­  Iâ€™m using the current unusality of times to learn stuff that I wanted to learn since quite a while but couldn't 'cause I was busy somewhere on a production..


ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m playing around with code, Touchdesigner, Ableton, DMX gear, sensors, cameras and other such tools to make things blink or do something interactive that I think might make sense, in particular while creating visual art and effects for media productions or immersive experiences.

ðŸ’¬  Before this I worked as a Gaffer or Lighting Technician in the Movies since 1998. In between I studied systems theory and cybernetics, so I'm good with logic based stuff and complex correlations.


ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on fun stuff, but I'm quite busy, so it has to be really good fun..
Generally I'm interested in culture and art and I like to create live experiences like events, retreats, adventure trips or art- or humanitarian interventions..
